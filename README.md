I am a student at Sanskriti University with a major in Computer Science. I have a passion for Cyber Security and information technology. 
I have used computer programming since I was in grade school. This passion has given me the ability to and develop programs for a multitude of things,programming languages, and databases.
Technology excites me and I am awe of the change it drives in the world. 
Certain skills that I have worked with include Data structure and Algorithms(Python), Linux Operating System, Networking ,Penetration Testing.And what I might lack in skills I make up for with my determination to learn.
